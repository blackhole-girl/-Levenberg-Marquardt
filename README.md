# -Levenberg-Marquardt
A project to calculate the velocity of clouds in the broad line region of AGNs using LM algorithm as a minimisation method.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The code used in this project for the LM algorithm is obtained from Numerical Recipes in C. Here, I only implement this code to the AGN data.
